               The world economy, industry and sciences are becoming increasingly digitized, and these 
               developments are disrupting society and familiar social processes. Women, however, are 
               still largely underrepresented in technology fields. Zonta International is pleased to 
               offer its new Zonta International Women in Technology Scholarship to encourage women to 
               pursue education, career opportunities and leadership roles in technology.
